# Module 14 Challenge: bikesharing

## Overview of the Analysis
Goal is to analyze bike trip data in NYC in month of Aug. There is plenty of infomration that can be learned from this data such as how long a bike was used and which bikes are due for repair.  
In the challenge we are after the following:
* The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week

In the next section, these information will be provided. The online dashboard can be found at: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jeff.modarres/viz/Module14_Challenge_16538794399490/NYCBIKEDATA
